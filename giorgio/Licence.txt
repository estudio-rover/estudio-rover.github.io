Thank you very much to all those who made donations for this font! It helped immensely.

As a show of gratitude I am making this font completely free for personal and commercial use, no license needed! Enjoy and keep designing.

If you enjoy this font, it might be nice to share it with someone else who might like it as well.

Much love and labor went into the creation of this font, and many many hours were spent designing and fine tuning it. This is the most involved font I have created to date. It comes in both a light and regular weight.

Thank you for your time and happy designing!
